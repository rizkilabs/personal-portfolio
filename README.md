## 📱 Responsive Design

The site is fully responsive:

* Large screens: grid layout for cards
* Tablets: adjusted spacing and font sizes
* Mobile: stacked layout with simplified navigation

Use browser dev tools or press `F12` → toggle mobile view to test responsiveness.

## 🌙 Dark Mode

* Toggle dark/light mode using the 🌙/☀️ button in the navigation bar.
* User preferences are stored using `localStorage`.
* Dark mode uses CSS variables for easy theming.

## 🧪 How to Test Components

### Test `.cards` Layout

1. Add multiple `.card` items inside a `.cards` container in any section.
2. Resize the browser to observe how the layout changes (1–3 columns).
3. Ensure cards wrap cleanly and spacing is consistent.

### Test Contact Form

* Fill in the form and ensure input focus styles appear.
* Note: Form submission is not connected to a backend (static demo only).
